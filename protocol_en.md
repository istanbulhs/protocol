## “Hacking”

"Hacking means exploring the limits of what is possible, in a spirit of playful cleverness. Activities that display playful cleverness have "hack value". " Richard M. Stallman (RMS)

## Space

The content of this section is a reminder for the space.
Still, it's documented for interested parties.

istanbul hackerSpace is an organic place; in this section it defines a direction which it will adhere to follow.
So this section organizes discourse and deeds in the name of the space. 

\# From now on "istanbul hackerSpace" will be referenced as "HS".

HS, detests the question "Why ?". Because the answer always is "Because we can". The right question would be "How ?"

HS, sees manipulation as an integral part of creative progress.

HS, operates within the GNU philosophy[1]. All products of the space would be "free" as in
defined this philosophy. For example if it produces software, hardware or documentation they
would be free thus licensed with a GNU approved license[2].

HS, defines free as "free" and non-free as "proprietary". This definition is not
limited to openness of the source.

HS, stands clear from both creators and advocates of proprietary software.

HS, doesn't designate hats for the creators and products of hack culture

HS, doesn't limit hack culture and hackers with security or software

HS, prefers repairing things instead of buying new. HS considers all material to be
valueable enough to store for future use.

HS, unequivocally opposes digital surveillance. We wouldn't be involved with any person, 
organization or project which helps, supports or even praises the surveillance apparatus.

HS, reserves the right to explore the limits of the possible.
